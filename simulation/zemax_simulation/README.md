(1) CompoundEyeball_hexaoptdistribution10degree_test.zmx
it is the zemax simulation file for the compound eye ball with 121 pixels. the cone angle difference is 10 degree. And the D/L ratio is 1/5.
(2) CompoundEyeball_hexaoptdistribution20degree.zmx
it is the zemax simulation file for the compound eye ball with 37 pixels. the cone angle difference is 10 degree. And the D/L ratio is 2/5.
(3) CompoundEyeball_hexaoptdistribution20degree_twoeyeS.zmx
it is the zemax simulation file for the two compound eye ball with 37 pixels. The two eye balls have 60 degree diviation from each other in normal direction. The light source is a point source for the motion and detection of the word "S".
